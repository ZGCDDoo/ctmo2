The params file
================

The parameter files used to specify the details of the Monte Carlo simulations are 
in the *json* format. This file format is convinient, readable and also ubiquitous.
While reading the following descriptions, please open up the file 'test/Simulations/holstein_DMFT_T0.3/params1.json'
to follow along. The name of the parameters follow the simple camelCase convention.


monteCarlo
-----------
The parameters in this sub-json specify the monte carlo specific details:


    measurementTime: float
        The time in minutes each processor measures.

    thermalizationTime: float
        The time in minutes for which each processor will thermalize. It is difficult to give a good
        optimal value. I would say, ~10% of the measurement time.

    seed: int
        The seed for the random number generator.

    thermalizeFromConfig: bool
        Should the program thermalize or simply start measuring format
        the previously saved configuraion.
        if true thermalizes from the previously saved configuration.
